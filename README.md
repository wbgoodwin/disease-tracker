# disease-tracker

Getting Started:
I recommend visual studio code, but any editor will work.

1. Clone this repository
2. Download nodejs https://nodejs.org/en/ . The most recent LTS version is fine.
3. Download docker desktop https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop . Docker is a way to containerize applications. I use this for storing my databases. It makes it more managable. Docker also makes it easier to deploy and set up CI/CD pipleines.


Running the Project:
1. Navigate to /disease-tracker/frontend in the terminal
2. Enter `npm start`
3. The frontend should be running on http://localhost:3000

backend to come later when we know what db we are using...


Frameworks:
* React (specifically react hooks) https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html
